      <h6 style="color: white">Just a teenager who's discovering and making stuff because of boredom.</h6>
      <p style="color: white">I discovered this hobby when I was 12. At that time I'm bored in the house and an idea came to my mind,  "What if I made my own game" and so I did. I used this game engine called 'Max2D' it's available on a phone so it's pretty convenient for me because I have no desktop (I'm writing this code on my phone as of now LOL) the games I made with it are called 'Epic Origin' 'MaxSpace' 'Brutalpath' 'Dodge It' 'Bob the Balloon Guy'. MaxSpace and Brutalpath are the honorable games I made because I think those two are well made game. </p>
